# SPIN TO WIN!

This plugin's designed to go with [Maker's Spleef](https://minemakers.net/makers-spleef-2). Once there are only two players left, a countdown starts until the MOLES ARE RELEASED! All the dead players come back to life to wreck havoc, and are unkillable.

Drop this bad boy in your `plugins` folder and you're good to go!

### Commands:
`/spin seconds <seconds>`: Sets the announcement delay.
`/spin announce <seconds>`: Set how many seconds we should wait before MOLE MODE after it's down to the final two.
`/spin reload`: Reloads config.

### Permissions:
