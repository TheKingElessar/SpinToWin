# SPIN TO WIN!

This plugin's designed to go with [Maker's Spleef](https://minemakers.net/makers-spleef-2). Once there are only two players left, a countdown starts until the MOLES ARE RELEASED! All the dead players come back to life to wreck havoc, and are unkillable.

Drop [this bad boy](https://github.com/TheKingElessar/SpinToWin/releases) in your `plugins` folder and you're good to go!
